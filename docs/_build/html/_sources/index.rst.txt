Documentation for the cern-snow-client library
==============================================

The CERN ServiceNow Client library (CERN SNow Client) facilitates the usage of the ServiceNow REST API with a
CERN account via Single Sign On authentication. Basic Authentication is also supported.

Low level operations such as get, post and put are implemented. Also, other higher level operations
have been implemented, such as querying/inserting/updating records,
or querying/inserting/updating incidents and requests, including adding comments and work notes.
